# List Mac Keyboard Shortcuts

Annoyed that I couldn't find a solid list of recent mac keyboard
shortcuts, I wrote code that gets the OS's and outputs it in a human-ish
readable form. So JSON.

I'm not certain of Return or BackTab, but those are my best guesses.

Requires MacOS. Ignores your customized ones in ~/Library/KeyBindings/.

* `@` is Command
* `^` is Control
* `~` is Option/Alt
* `$` is Shift
