# List Mac Keyboard Shortcuts

Annoyed that I couldn't find a solid list of recent mac keyboard
shortcuts, I wrote code that gets the OS's and outputs it in a human-ish
readable form. So JSON.

I'm not certain of Return or BackTab, but those are my best guesses.

Requires MacOS. Ignores your customized ones in ~/Library/KeyBindings/.

* <kbd>⌘</kbd> is Command
* <kbd>^</kbd> is Control
* <kbd>⌥</kbd> is Option/Alt
* <kbd>⇧</kbd> is Shift
